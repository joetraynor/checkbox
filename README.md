###FYI: Didn't manage to ge the styling done in the allotted time, however I believe the functionality is all working as intended. Check the state/console.


1. What do you enjoy most/least about engineering?
The reason I do this is for the satisfaction of getting something working. Having an initial problem, working out the solution and building it so that it works without flaws gives me a lot of satisfaction.
My least favourite part about it is when you have been sat there coding for hours and hours and cannot work out a problem.
The best thing to do is to just have a half an hour break and come back to the problem, but it is so difficult to leave a problem half solved.
2. Tell us about the most challenging engineering feature you have worked on in the past year?
The most challenging would most likely be the Alexa skill that I helped build. As I had never done anything like it before, it was difficult to go understand how a user is supposed to flow through a conversation. Once I cracked that, it became easier, but that was by far th emost difficult bit.
3. To whom did you turn for help the last time that you ran into a major technical problem, and why did you choose that person?
One of the senior devs in my team. A very understanding person who helps you work out the problem instead of just telling you the answer, and I think there is a ke difference between the two.
4. Tell us about a time when a fellow engineer turned to you for help?
Another dev was starting up a new project that used a serverless framework and was struggling to set the Lambdas up. I had done it quite a few times before and so I was on hand to assist in any way I could. 
5. Tell us about a time when you worked on a feature that failed, Did you learn anything?
The nature of my current team means that many things that we build will not go anywhere. If we cannot find a business sponsor to fund the project, the initial proof of concept will be scrapped. I learnt to make sure whatever you build is as relevant and useful as possible so that they cannot refuse to continue with it.
6. What is your opinion on javascript frameworks?
There are a lot... I personally prefer vanilla JS, however a framework such as React does make life easier and more efficient so it is definiely worth learning. However picking the right framework can be a tiresome task as there are so many frameworks.
7. Describe your ideal working day
It would be a mix of coming across existing problems and solving them, and building new features from scratch. I do love both approaches so it would be a mix of the two, maybe have the morning bug fixing which leaves the afternoon open to new features.
8. One year from now what do you hope to have achieved â€” from an engineering perspective?
I hope to have contributed to a real-world application, and know that the changes/features I build are being used by thousands of people. When I can see features I have built being used by thousands, I will be pleased.
